ACTION 5V5

A bit of brief about the project-
It's a third-perspective game where there are 2 teams and in one of the team the user will be controlling a entity and there are 9 other entity controlled by AI (4 on your team and the other 5 in other team). Both teams are differentiated by a highlighted text above the entities head.

Also the map is downloaded from Unreal Marketplace but i did edit by putting a lot of props here and there.

There is synchronized audio for the gun sound and gun hitting sound and there is overall audio try to match the map vibe overall.

If you do want to play the game download the files run it in Unreal and then go to
Content->Level and run the Stylized_Egypt_levelfinal.umap. If everything is right you would be able to play it.
